Closebracket lets you define multiple shell actions in a single command to
speed up the typing of the most repetitive shell commands.
The command name of Closebracket is `]' and `][', that's because these
characters are near the "Enter" key and it is easy to type them fast.

`]' stands for "primary fire", while `][' is the secondary one.

After few days you'll find Closebracket very addictive.

Closebracket is dedicated to the God of Laziness, may He bless you (when He 
feels to do it).


*** Installation 

Download the latest tarball from
http://www.freaknet.org/alpt/src/utils/closebracket/tarball/

Use the ./install.sh script to install it. It will copy the files in
~/.closebracket and add some aliases in ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc)

*** Updating

Just use ./install.sh (or install-rshells.sh).
`closebracket.conf' will be overwritten but your `shells' file won't.

*** Usage

Since too many words are needed to describe all the actions that are included
by default, I'll show you them by examples.
Keep in mind that you can tune them and define your own actions by editing the
~/.closebracket/closebracket.conf file.

In the first line closebracket is used to activate an action. The second line
is the equivalent of that action.

##
###  Basic shell movements
##

$ ]
$ ls	# ls current directory

$ ][
$ cd	# cd to home

$ ] dir/
$ cd dir/

$ ][ dir/
$ ls dir/

$ ][ file
$ cat file

$ ][ non_existent_file
$ vim non_existent_file

##
###  Remote shells
##

$ ] shell			# With closebracket you keep the list of the
$ ssh shell.expanded.org	# name of your remote shells in 
				# ~/.closebracket/shells. In this case we put
				# "shell.expanded.org" in the list.
				# Closebracket searches the closest match with
				# the word you typed and then use that as the
				# remote shell hostname.
$ ] user@shell
# ssh user@shell.expanded.org

$ ] shell user
$ ssh user@shell.expanded.org

##
###  Remote copy (scp/rsync)
##

$ ] shell:file
$ vim scp://shell.expanded.org/file	# Beware of the Vim power

$ ] user@shell:/path/file
$ ] scp://user@shell.expanded.org/path/file

$ ][ shell:dir/
$ scp -r shell.expanded.org:dir/ .

$ ][ shell:dir/ local_dir/
$ scp -r shell.expanded.org:dir/ local_dir/

$ ][ file1 file3 dir1 dir3 shell:remote_dir/
$ scp -r file1 file3 dir1 dir3 shell.expanded.org:remote_dir/


##
###  URLs, mail addresses
##

$ ] http://URL
$ firefox http://URL

$ ][ http://URL
$ wget http://URL

$ ] email@address.org
$ mutt email@address.org


##
###  File type based on extension
##

It is possible to associate multiple extensions to a program or a
function. Ex: associate ".jpg .bmp" to gqview and to the gimp, using
respectively the former as primary action and the latter as secondary.

The extensions list is kept in ~/.closebracket/file_extensions


$ ] pack.tar.gz				# This works for .tar, .tar.bz2,
$ tar xfz pack.tar.gz; cd pack/		# .tar.gz, .tgz, .zip, .rar
					# If the directory unpacked isn't the
					# same of the filename of the tarball
					# it understands that ^_-
					
$ ] file.pdf
$ xpdf file.pdf			# If you are in tty, it converts the pdf file
				# to html and opens it with links

$ ] movie_or_mp3.ogg		# .avi, .mp3, .wav, .wmv, ...
$ mplayer movie_or_mp3.ogg

$ ] image.jpg			# .jpg, .png, .gif, ...
$ gqview image.jpg		# if you are in tty it launches `seejpeg'

$ ][ image.jpg
$ gimp image.jpg

$ ] file.htm			# .htm, .html, .php, ...
$ firefox file.htm		# if you are in tty it launches `links' instead

$ ] file.torrent
$ bittorrent file.torrent	# if you are in tty, it launches
				# bittorrent-curses

$ ] file.abw 
$ abiword file.abw

You can also pass options to it:

$ ] video.avi -nosound
$ mplayer video.avi -nosound

- [ "$?" = n ] -> [ $? -eq n]: working also on zsh 
- [ a == b ] -> [ a = b ]: working also on zsh

0.0.6

- directory bug solved: with the 0.0.5 it wasn't possible to change dir to
  directories with spaces in their names

0.0.5

- Code optmisised and beautified (Iain Calder <{ic56} at {rogers.com}> )

- cd, ls commands are now executed with eval, in this way if you redefine
  them as alias, during an interactive shell session, they will be expanded.

- Code cleaned: we now use the "$@" bash feature

- removed the "bc -l" feature

0.0.4

- ] file:line  ==>  vim file +line

- The untarra script will now repair broken tar/zip/rar archives, i.e. arhives
  that would decompress files in ./
  Thanks to http://people.debian.org/~filippo/btar for the inspiration


0.0.3

- An modular method to match file extensions has been implemented.
  It is possible to associate multiple extensions to a program or a
  function. Ex: associate ".jpg .bmp" to gqview and to the gimp, using
  respectively the former as primary action and the latter as secondary.
  	] picture.jpg    is equivalent to    gqview picture.jpg
  	][ picture.jpg   is equivalent to    gimp  picture.jpg

  The extensions list is kept in ~/.closebracket/file_extensions

- The support for "ftp://" URI has been added.


0.0.2

- The support for .torrent files has been added. They are opened with
  bittorrent and bittorrent-curses if you are respectively on X or in tty.

- The support for .pdf files has been added. The default action is to open
  them with xpdf. If you are in tty, it converts the pdf file to html and
  opens it with links
  
- "] user@shell" is now parsed correctly


0.0.1

- initial release

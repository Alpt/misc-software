			  SUCAST
	  http://freaknet.org/alpt/src/misc/sucast/	


A collective-web-streaming-server written in ~60 lines of shell script, during 
the Italian hackmeeting 2007.

Sucast shows a list of available video/audio files. When a client clicks on a
link, the relative file will be opened with mplayer.

The best way to use sucast is launching it inside rwm
  http://www.freaknet.org/alpt/src/patches/rwm
As result, any user will be able to play its video: a new mplayer window will
be opened, the screen will be divided equally, while each window tries to
occupy the greatest available space.

To use it with rwm run ./install.sh, and then use ./run.sh

*WARNING* configure sucast.sh before launching it (f.e, modify the INCOMING
variable)

Note: each IP may launch at maximum a single file. If the same IP launches
      another one, the old will be killed to favour the new.

		             xmplayer 
			
		     A XMMS replacement in bash
	http://www.freaknet.org/alpt/src/utils/xmplayer/


The name of xmplayer derives from xm(ms)mplayer.

Xmplayer executes, only once, mplayer in background and controls it
through a FIFO. It supports all the (useful) features you'll find in XMMS and
it is easily extendible.
However, unlike XMMS, Xmplayer doesn't require any X server active. You can
even use it from a remote shell. Indeed, this was the main reason for its
development.

Xmplayer has also some unique features like `jgrep' that lets you jump to the
first "grepped" match of the playlist.

*** Installation 

Download the latest tarball from
http://www.freaknet.org/alpt/src/utils/xmplayer/tarball/

There are some advised aliases you can set up in your shell.
Use "./xmplayer --alias" to get the complete list.

*** Updating

Just overwrite the old xmplayer file.

*** Usage

xmplayer --help
---------------

   Command line:

        xmplayer [command]

        You can pass xmplayer commands directly to command line, f.e:
                  xmplayer help;  xmplayer help help; xmplayer play

   Shell:
        xmplayer -i || xmplayer shell || xmplayer -s

        Reads one line at time from standrd input and execute
        the given commands.

Note: all your temporary files are kept in: /tmp/xmplayer/`whoami`.*

Playlists
---------

A few words on the playlists management.
Xmplayer keeps _two_ playlists.

The first is the last _loaded_ playlist, i.e. the last playlist you created.
For example:
	xmplayer loadlist mylist.m3u
	xmplayer load xjapan.mp3 album/
the _loaded_ playlist will be `mylist.m3u' concatenated with xjapan.mp3 and
all the files contained in album/.

The second is instead the _current_ playlist: each time you issue a command
which operates on any playlist, the current playlist will be updated.
For example:
	xmplayer rand
the current playlist will now contain your last loaded playlist in a shuffled
order.

General use
-----------

Keeping in mind what we've in the above section, you can now take a look at
the help and just use it:

	xmplayer help

Tip: if you use "xmplayer quit", then the next time you'll use xmplayer, it
     will load the last played playlist and position.

Examples
--------

xmplayer loadlist ~/mp3/lists/listXJAPAN.m3u	# Load the playlist
xmplayer load ~/mp3/Er_Marchio_-_FTW.mp3 Tripz/ # Append in the loaded
						# the single .mp3 file and all
						# the files contained in Tripz/

xmplayer play
xmplayer rand

xmplayer next 10		# jump 10 tracks ahead

xmplayer jgrep crucify
>>> Jumping to ' /home/alpt/mp3/X_japan/04-X JAPAN _ Crucify My Love.mp3'

xmplayer cur			# display the position of the _current_ playlist
>>> 1       04-X JAPAN _ Crucify My Love.mp3

xmplayer curl			# display the position of the _loaded_ playlist
>>> 87      04-X JAPAN _ Crucify My Love.mp3

xmplayer savelist ~/mp3/lists/my_new_list.m3u

xmplayer quote mute		# quote any of the `mplayer -input cmdlist' cmds

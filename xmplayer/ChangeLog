0.0.4

- When jumping to the last loaded playlist, xmplayer exits from shuffle mode.
  This bug has been fixed.

- If xmplayer is already running, the `play' command rewinds the current
  track.


0.0.3

- Added the `jcgrep' command:

	  jcgrep      --   Jump to the first matched entry of the
	                   _current_ playlist. Useful to skip to the
	                   next match

- Fixed some regular expression bugs


0.0.2

- The `mute' and `seek' mplayer commands are now recognized.

- jgrep supports now multiple patterns separated by spaces, f.e. 
  `xmplayer jgrep danubio blu'

- The support for a continous playlist has been added. If the current track is
  the last one, `Next' will teleport on the first one. The opposite is for `Prev'.

- Mutexes has been added: if two instances of xmplayer have been executed
  nearly at the same time, they won't overlap, because one of the two will
  wait the finish of the execution of the other.

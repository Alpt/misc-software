#  How to reach the Internet anonymously from a hostile network
#	 http://freaknet.org/alpt/src/utils/prayishtar
#
# This script forwards ALL your Internet traffic over secure SSH tunnels.
#
# ** Requirements **
#  You need one trusted SSH servers (`myhome') and possibly another one with a
#  BIG BIG (`bigbwhost').
#  You also need OpenSSH >= 4.3 on both this localhost and on `myhome'.
#  Be sure also to have the support for /dev/tun, iptables and LARTC.
# 
# ** This is what we do **
#  We forward all of our Internet traffic trough a SSH vpn created with
#  `myhome' and we use `bigbwhost' as a SSH proxy for applications which require
#  a big bandwidth (like browsers):
#
# 	All outgoing Internet traffic -> SSH VPN -> myhome -> INTERNET
#
#	All outgoing http traffic -> SSH SOCKS proxy -> bigbwhost -> INTERNET
# 
# ** TODO **
#  Use Tor to create the SSH connections
#
# ** Usage **
#  The first command:
# 	  # prayishtar  myhomehost 
#  If you have available the `bigbwhost' use instead:
# 	  # prayishtar  myhomehost bigbwhost bighostuser
#  f.e.:
#	  # prayishtar home.dyndns.org mybigserver.org foo
#
#  You can also configure directly this script and launch it with no arguments:
#	  # prayishtar
# 
# 2) If you have the `bigbwhost', in the browser set a localhost:8080 SOCKS proxy.
# 
# 3) You are done! Cryptolized trough SSH juicy tunnels. Even your dns query
#    will be encrypted!
#    Enjoy ^_^
#
# 4) Use "prayishtar stop" to clean the mess created by this script.

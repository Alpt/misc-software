Pwdrc lets you executes your set of commands each time you walk in a directory
with `cd'. You can associate a different set of commands to each directory.


*** USAGE

Each time you walk in a directory the file .`whoami`_pwdrc is read and
executed (if it exists), thus if your user name is "foo", your pwdrc
file is ".foo_pwdrc".
You can use the `cdd' command, instead of `cd', to avoid the execution of the
pwdrc file.


			*** WARNING ***
Pwdrc executes _ONLY_ pwdrc file which are owned by your user name and 
cannot be read/written/executed by anyone else than yourself. 
So be sure to use: chmod 600 .`whomai`_pwdrc
			*** WARNING ***


When you exit from the directory where you put a pwdrc file, Pwdrc executes
the function close_pwdrc() which was defined in it. This is useful to restore
aliases you have modified (see the COOKBOOK section below in this text).
If you set, in your pwdrc file, the PDWRC_RECURSE variable to 1, then
close_pwdrc() will be called only when you walk in a upper directory.

If the variable PWDRC_RECURSE_FUNC is set to 1 the function recurse_pwdrc()
will be called each time you walk in a sub-directory. 
For example, the pwdrc script below will print the current path each time you
walk into a sub-directory:

	PWDRC_RECURSE_FUNC=1
	recurse_pwdrc() {
		pwd
	}
	


NOTE:   Please use unique variable names in your pwdrc files, since they may
	collide with other pwdrc variables when PDWRC_RECURSE is enabled.
NOTE2:	It is adviced to put close_pwdrc() at the beginning of your pwdrc
	file.


Examples:

If you want to do an `ls' each time you walk in the directory pkg/ just
do:

echo ls > pkg/.`whoami`_pwdrc
chmod 600  pkg/.`whoami`_pwdrc

In order to walk in pkg/ without executing the pwdrc file do:

cdd pkg/
